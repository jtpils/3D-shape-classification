# 3D-shape-classification
Classifcation of volumetric shapes using Deep Neural Networks.

Starting from the ShapeNet architecture (http://3dshapenets.cs.princeton.edu/) this notebook implements a 3D object classification strategy based on CNNs. The execution of the code requires having downloaded first the 3DShapeNets code archive (available at the link above reported). More detailed information is given in the notebook.
